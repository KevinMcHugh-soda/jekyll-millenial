We're very glad to have such loving, supporting friends and family. Your love and time is all we ask for. If you'd like to give us a gift to help welcome Baby McHugh into the world, [we have a registry on Babylist](my.babylist.com/jonna-mchugh). 

We also appreciate books of all sorts.

If you're intending on buying clothes, this guide might make sizing easy: 

|March| 2 months|
|June| 5 months|
|September| 8 months|
|December| 11 months|

Finally, we both grew up in plenty of hand-me-downs and have many fond memories. New's not neccessary.
