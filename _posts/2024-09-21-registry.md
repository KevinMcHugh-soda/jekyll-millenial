Gifts are not expected but we do have [a registry](https://my.babylist.com/jonna-mchugh) if you want to get us something we’ll need. We love hand me downs and used baby gear! We won’t be opening gifts at the party so we can spend as much time as possible chatting with our guests.

Our philosophy on colors and gender: Kevin and Jonna believe that all clothing colors and all toys can be enjoyed by all babies, regardless of gender! We want our son to be encouraged to wear whatever colors he likes, so a variety is appreciated.

If you're intending on buying clothes, this guide might make sizing easy: 

|March| 2 months|
|June| 5 months|
|September| 8 months|
|December| 11 months|
